TO CODE!

WHAT ARE WE DOING?

CODING!

WHAT SHOULD WE DO!

CODE! CODE! CODE!

## My Purpose

This page is for the glorification of the coding projects I do in this class. All my blood sweat and tears have resulted in this fine code. I think jekyll is stupid though. I think creating a page from scratch using html would've achieved the same purpose. I don't like jekyll
