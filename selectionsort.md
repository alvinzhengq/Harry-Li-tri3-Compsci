# Selection Sorting Algorithms analysis:
## Terms to know:
  - time complexity 
      - amount of computer time it takes to run the algorithm
  - space complexity
      - amount of memory required by the algorithm until complete execution
## Selection Sort:
How it works:
  - loops through nth element to last element of array
  - always begins with n=0 and n increments by 1 each time elements are traversed
  - each time we traverse array, we find smallest element and swap it with nth position element
